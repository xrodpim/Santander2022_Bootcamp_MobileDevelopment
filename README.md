# Santander2022_Bootcamp_MobileDevelopment
Repository of projects developed during a bootcamp supported by bank Santander and Dio, in Brazil.

Dio is a kind of online school/platform that offers courses on software development in Brazil. With a partnership between Banco Santander and Dio, in 2022 they offered a bootcamp to accelerate the gain of knowledge in this area, among those interested in working with information technologies.

This repository contains the source code of the system built to be applied on mobile devices, such as cell phones.

The bootcamp was an excellent opportunity to recycle professionals, giving us more skills in software development.
